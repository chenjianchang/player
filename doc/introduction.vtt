00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.759 align:start position:0%
hi i'm remington from southern shoddy 3d
 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.519 align:start position:0%
and today we're going to be learning how
 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
to animate your first character if
 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
you're like me you love creating
 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
characters and imagine them in your own
 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
little worlds with animation you can
 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
finally bring your characters to life 3d
 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
is difficult and aside from the fact
 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
that there is another entire dimension
 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.439 align:start position:0%
to worry about we also have all these
 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:29.199 align:start position:0%
intimidating programs we have to learn
 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
and in this course we'll cover the
 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.559 align:start position:0%
basics of blender's user interface and
 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
be moving at a pace that should be
 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
comfortable for beginners this course
 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
will provide a character rig for you to
 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.719 align:start position:0%
use and animate i will also walk you
 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:40.079 align:start position:0%
through places you can grab other
 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
character rigs if you want to follow
 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.800 align:start position:0%
along with a different character we'll
 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.399 align:start position:0%
be creating this animation by the end of
 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.039 align:start position:0%
the course 3d is a high demand right now
 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
and since i've added it to my skill set
 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
i found better higher paying clients i
 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
think this course is great for anybody
 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
who wants to explore 3d 3d artists game
 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
devs or even animators looking to add 3d
 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.120 align:start position:0%
to their skill set a little bit about me
 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.879 align:start position:0%
i started as a motion graphics artist
 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
working at small studios and agencies
 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
and eventually worked my way up to
 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
larger brands and tech companies now i
 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
work at a social media giant out here in
 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
silicon valley and i get to do character
 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
animation every day i really love my job
 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
and i believe that the skills in this
 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
course could help you find your dream
 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
creative job as well we'll not be
 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.080 align:start position:0%
covering rigging in this course because
 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
rigging is the process of adding
 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
animation controls to your 3d model of
 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
characters it's a highly technical
 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.799 align:start position:0%
process that would demand an entire
 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:28.479 align:start position:0%
course on its own if this is something
 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:29.840 align:start position:0%
that interests you i'll link to some
 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
free and paid resources in the resources
 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.200 align:start position:0%
section i've also included a full
 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
recording of my modeling and rigging
 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.799 align:start position:0%
process if you're interested in watching
 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
that as well i'm really excited to share
 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.159 align:start position:0%
this project with you and i'm looking
 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
forward to see what animations you
 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.439 align:start position:0%
create from this course so let's get
